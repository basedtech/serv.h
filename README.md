# Desktop Web App Library
- This is a "more practical" replacement for frameworks like Electron, Webview, and Tauri
- Instead of opening a new browser instance (which uses a lot of RAM), this library starts a HTTP web
server that allows communication with a C backend.
- The user is given a link to open in their favorite browser.

Currently, this library is in development and not intended for use in software yet.

### Future plans
- [x] Support Linux
- [x] Support Windows
- [ ] Implement better/faster bindings
- [ ] Parse POST requests
- [ ] Open a small window when running the app with instructions
